# Shor-s-algorithm
# This code implements modular exponentiation, with IBM's qiskit
# Modular Exponentiation is the most challenging part of Shor's algorithm
# Studying this particular part of the algorithm was motivated by the youtube video series on Shor's algorithm by Abraham Asfaw
# Primarily the following sources were used:
